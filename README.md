# Teenspirit
*I'd rather kiss a Wookiee!*

A not-so-space-invading 18-key ergonomic keyboard with two Piezo-buzzers and a retro-toy looking case.

## BOM
- 1 Teenspirit PCB
- 1 Seeed XIAO compatible controller, like e.g. [Miao](https://github.com/kilipan/miao)
- 9 sot23 diodes (common cathode)
- 18 kailh choc low profile switches
- 18 fitting keycaps

## Firmware
Currently [ZMK firmware](https://github.com/kilipan/zmk-config-teenspirit) and [FAK firmware](https://github.com/kilipan/fak-config/tree/main/keyboards/teenspirit) are available. Neither allows using the buzzers as of yet, but ZMK should soon™️! :)

## Production Files
All files are provided under CERN-OHL-S license.
### PCB
Gerbers for producing the PCB can be found in [`prod/pcb`](https://github.com/kilipan/teenspirit/tree/main/prod/pcb).

### Case
The fantastic case was designed by DizzySkizzo (`dizzyskizzo1337` on discord). Thank you for letting me use and open source this genius design!
Production files available in [`prod/case`](https://github.com/kilipan/teenspirit/tree/main/prod/case).

## Example Keymap
Take this as an inspiration for how typing on this can work very well, not a fixed way to do things! :)
